## 🗂️ Branch Naming Convention

We did **not create separate branches** for this project since the majority of the work focused on **documentation and integration deliverables** rather than ongoing feature development.

However, the standard convention intended for this repository (if needed) would follow:

feat/<feature-name> → new feature or component
fix/<bug-description> → bug fixes or corrections
infra/<config-task> → infrastructure or CI/CD-related changes
